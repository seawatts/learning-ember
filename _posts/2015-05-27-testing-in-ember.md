Over the next couple of months I will be writing a series of posts about how to test your Ember.js applications.

I will be covering the following scenarios:

## Acceptance testing
* ember-cli-mirage
* Built-in and custom test helpers
* Navagation
* Pagination
* Session managment

## Unit Testing
* Promises
* Services
* Controllers
* Components
* Adapters
* Serializers
* Routes
* Initializers
